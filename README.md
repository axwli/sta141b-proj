Gerrymandering, or the act of manipulating electoral district boundaries to give a particular party or group unfair advantage, is a common tactic used to suppress minority voters in the United States. North Carolina is one of many historically gerrymandered states, but in recent years, efforts have been made to draw fairer district lines. For this reason, we compared North Carolina’s 2016 district map to the 2020 district map by analyzing the spatial distributions of various demographic groups to assess whether or not these redistricting efforts indeed resulted in fairer boundaries. All data was collected by web-scraping and PDF-parsing North Carolina’s voter statistics, demographic groups, and population numbers. Our results show that, after the district map was redrawn for the 2020 election, many districts exhibited less characteristics of cracking and packing voters. This analysis is important because it helps to determine whether recent redistricting efforts have succeeded in fairly representing all voters, particularly minority groups, and provides a look into the ongoing fight for electoral fairness.
